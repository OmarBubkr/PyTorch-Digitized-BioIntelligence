# Construction of Digital Reasoning Models with PyTorch

 
# Definition of Digital Intelligence(DI):
Feild of study that builds & developes **digital brains** simulating the biological brain, based on The Process of **Layered/Hierarchical Processing** and **Probabilistic Modeling**


**The Process of Layered/Hierarchical Processing:** Simulating the biological brain's cordical processes (e.g The Visual & Audial Cotrices in building Visual & Audial Awareness through layers. Initial layers extract simple low level features, and subsequent layers extract more advanced high level ones(**context**), from the image or sound <==> eyes or ears) 


**Probabilistic Modeling:** Simulating the Prefrontal Cortex's neural network in **logical reasoning** and rational decison making 

**Visual Cortex:** The Building of **meta-visual** hierarchical awareness

**Prefrontal Cortex:** The Building of hierarchical **meta-reason** (Behavioural, long term risk assessment, compulsory, decision center, planning & prediction)
 
**Intelligence:** 

• Multi-Cortical Systems 
• Multi-Density Neuronal Connectivity 
• Long-Short-Term Neuronal Connections (Cross-Cortical-Hemispheric)
• Interconnected Shared-Cross-Referenced Reasoning 
• Decomposable Chain Of Vector Transformations
• Feature Hierarchy Formation
• Latent Manifold Structuring 
• Relational Inductive Biases
• Adaptive Meta-Modulation Loops 
• Meta-Cognitive 
• Modular
• Efficient 


Context = Meta-Level Awareness  = Abstraction
